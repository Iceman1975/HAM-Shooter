# Amiga HAM Shooter Demo

The 16-Bit-Studio sources, the generated code as well as the executable demo are now available here. The demo includes only one level. The background is based on the arcade version of Aero Fighters, the bob opponents and their explosions are from open-game art and the sprites are exclusively from Xenon 2. The aim was to achieve maximum color contrast. In addition, Xenon 2 only uses 16 colors, so all sprites look excellent and without restrictions as in the original game.
